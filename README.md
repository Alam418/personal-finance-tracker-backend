## 🧹 To Do (Optional Enhancements)

Add unit/integration tests (e.g., with Jest)

Add admin role or management panel

- All transactions are scoped to the logged-in user.
- Default categories and a "Dompet" account are created when registering.
- Dates are stored as ISO strings (`YYYY-MM-DD`).
- API is designed to be **lightweight** and for **manual input**, not automation.
